          </h1>
          <p className="font-normal text-xl leading-6 text-gray-600 ">
            Originally from Hong Kong🇭🇰, I moved to Taiwan🇹🇼 since my university
            years and am currently pursuing a degree in Electrical Engineering
            at National Taiwan University. My enthusiasm for coding has driven
            me to engage in a variety of projects, covering areas such as Unity,
            website development, Raspberry Pi, and blockchain technologies. In
            addition to my academic and coding endeavors, I have explored other
            interests by joining the AK Poker Club🃏 and Japanese Mahjong
            Club🀄️, reflecting my curiosity and eagerness to immerse myself in
            different cultures and activities.
