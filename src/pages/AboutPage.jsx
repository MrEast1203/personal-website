            HI, Originally from Hong Kong🇭🇰, I moved to Taiwan🇹🇼 since my
            university years and am currently pursuing a degree in Electrical
            Engineering at National Taiwan University. My enthusiasm for coding
            has driven me to engage in a variety of projects, covering areas
            such as Unity, website development, Raspberry Pi, and blockchain
            technologies. In addition to my academic and coding endeavors, I
            have explored other interests by joining the AK Poker Club🃏 and
            Japanese Mahjong Club🀄️, reflecting my curiosity and eagerness to
            immerse myself in different cultures and activities.
